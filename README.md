Machine-learning repository contains two branches:
1. main
2. model-optimised

In this repository, I will be buidling several ML model taking different datasets and problems.

File description:
1. breast_cancer_model_random_forest.py: I have used "Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)" dataset for analyzing breast cancer problem and built an ML model 
to detect breast cancer in females. In this python file, I have done EDA, data cleaning, normalization, built model using Random forest classifier, and checked 
performance of the model using accuracy as performance metric.

2. breast_cancer_dataset.csv: This is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset being used in the above python file.
